## About Me

<p>üöÄ Starting my scientific journey in computer engineering in 2015, I discovered a profound passion for machine learning through a key project classifying human emotions from EEG signals. This pivotal experience propelled my focus towards leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to tackle real-world challenges, especially in improving healthcare outcomes, as demonstrated in my published research. My expertise extends to robust software development, with over 10 years of programming experience in Java, JS, Python, MATLAB, and Flutter, enabling me to not only design complex ML models but also build and integrate them into scalable, user-friendly applications across multiple platforms.</p>
